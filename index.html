          <p>You swallow and noticed how dry and parched your throat is. It's practically a desert enclosed by a dank ivory prison. The only oasis in this hellhole of mouth-status would be a crisp carbonated beverage, bubbling with thrist-quenching liquidy goodness. Awww... Yeah..... <br />
          What is this magical blessing from the Gods, you ask? <br /></p>

    <!--True Facts-->

    <!--What is Soda?-->
        <section id="what">
          <header>
            <h3>Soda is a drank, you dogwit!</h3>
            <p>I use dogwit in an endearing, friendly-jab-at-the-family-dog kind of way. If you really need me to explain to you what a <em>soda</em> is, then you've at least found the best soda resource on the whole wide local intranet.</p>

            <!--Disclaimer-->
            <h4>Before we begin...</h4>
            <p>I need you to answer a few questions so that we are on the same page here:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Do you have a full coat of fur that resembles a canine species</li>
              <li>Does your only source of liquids and nutrition spring from the breast of mammals?</li>
              <li>Are you looking for a permanent replacement for olive oil?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the answer to any of these questions is <strong>yes</strong>, then you need to drop what you are doing and call your primary care physician to see if <span>soda is right for you</span>. I do not claim any responsibility for actions taken by others (and myself) as a result of being enlightened by sodalogy.</p>

          <!--Soda is a yummy drink-->
          <h4>Soda can be definied as water that's been pressurized with carbon gas, but it's so much more.</h4>
          <p>Soda builds and strengthens relationships, destroys and devistates families, musters courage in heroes, creates slaves to pleasure and monsters of men, maintains sanity on the brink of dehydration, and defines legends on a global stage.<br />
          Soda is a tool, a weapon, an authority, a crutch, a gift, and a luxery.<br />
          It may only seem like bubbly flavored water, but it's simplicity is its strength. It's easy to attribute characteristics to such a basic and common commodity.</p>

    <!--How expensive is soda?-->
        <section id="cost">
          <header>
            <h3>It's cheap AF</h3>
            <p>The best part about soda is that is super cheap and available everywhere in the USA</p>
          </header>
            <p>You would think that compared to water, which is just soda without the best parts, soda would be more expensive. <strong>Nope</strong>.<br />
            A bottle of soda costs marginally more than a bottle of water in a grocery store.</p>
